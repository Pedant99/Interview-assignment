# Interview-assignment-Netflux

A basic web application displaying favourite movies of a user with an option to add and delete the movies.  

### Project Summary 

#### Assumptions 

- Assignment Requirements -> No SignUp required
- Manually added list of movies to select from, for adding to the list

#### Technology and Frameworks used

- PHP, JavaScript, HTML, CSS and MySql were the languages used specifically because of the familiarity with these languages and also due to the fact that these go well with each other as a stack.
- Visual Studio code was used to test the code before putting it online on a hosting platform ( IONOS )
- Bootstrap used to make the login page  

#### Solution

The solution is presented through a basic web application which allows a registered user to login in, view thier favourite movies and an option to add, delete the movies. 

#### How to Use it ?

[Website](http://broonscots.com)
Enter the username and password ( ID in the database ) from the database, which will then allow you to view your favourite movies. You can click on 'Browse' to see, choose and add from a list of movies displayed. Then you can click on the Logo which takes you back to the login page. 

#### Known Errors and Security Concerns

- No known Errors
- No SSL added to the website

#### Limitations and Issues

- Remove button doesnt actually remove the movie from the database. __This brings into question the consistency of the website__ 
- A basic authentication provided and no authentication provider used for the login system.
- A very basic website design is done due to the time constraint and other factors 

#### Future Improvements

- A much better design for the application 
- Use of react framework for the code 
- Making the application more interactive and user-friendly
- Adding unit tests
- Providing an option to just search for a movie and add it, in addition to a list of movies 
- Hovering on to the poster to view the details as a dropdown would be interesting
- A more structured look to the website keeping it consistent
